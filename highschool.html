    This is my HighSchool Life, as i can recall i was once a student who has a few of friends <br>
	during this years i was not that confident to show myself i hesitate a lot <br> 
	about how i look and how i act. <br> And honestly i regret my decisions for not being an active student this time. <br> because i didn't join any clubs or organizations in our school.
