    And now i am already in college, enjoying and still exploring everything <br>
	i must say that i grow a lot, i experienced a lot i make to many circle of friends <br>
	And i became an adventurer at this very young age. <br> I was so happy that i matured well and maturing more and more, <br> hoping that this friendships i made in this college life will stay continue and make more memories in the future.
