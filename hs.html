        <P align="center"> This is my HighSchool Life, as i can recall i was once a student who has a few of friends 
            during this years i was not that confident to show myself i hesitate a lot 
            about how i look and how i act. And honestly i regret my decisions for not being an active student this time. <br> because i didn't join any clubs or organizations in our school. </P>
